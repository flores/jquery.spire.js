# Development

## Tests

CORs needs the html to on a server, there is a helper in the Cakefile for this you can run the test server via:

    cake test:server

If you don't know about cake and Cakefiles head on over to the CoffeeScript site (Don't worry this plugin isn't written in CoffeScript nor do you need it for anything other than running the development tasks)

## Bundle

So you made some changes and want to minify?

    cake bundle
